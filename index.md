# Welcome to the Laan71` homePage!

This sites main purpose is for school. I have just startet an education in computer science and I am going to use Github as a learning platform and to keep in touch with my teacher(s) and classmates :-)

I look forward to learning the different code languages and getting it into the backbone. To learn Markdown and to know how to make some words **bold"" and other words *italic*. I have no prior knowledge of coding and I know I have to take babysteps but I also know that with practice I will soon be running :-) 

## My favorite places to learn from so far:

  * Teachers in class
  * Educatinal books
  * SoloLearning
  * Udemy
