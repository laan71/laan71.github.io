# Welcome to the Laan71` homePage!

This sites main purpose is for school. I have just startet an education in computer science at Zealand, Naestved and I am going to use Github as a learning platform and to keep in touch with my teacher(s) and classmates :-)

I have 1 year of codingexperience in Java but I look forward to go deeper and get it into the backbone :-) 

## My favorite places to learn from so far:

  * Teachers in class
  * SoloLearning
  * Textbooks
  * Udemy
  * Google (Google is your friend - REALLY!)




When I am done I want to work with Computer Security or IOT and I am going to make a community for women so they will have a secure place where they donÂ´t feel insecure because of the majority of men in IT!
